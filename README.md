# Grid Based Path Finding - Dijkstra's algorithm
A grid based path finding system using a version of Dijkstra's algorithm created with AppGameKit.

## Library Goals
* Distances should be stored within each tile on a grid.
* The distances will then be used to work out the best path from the point to a destination.
* This way rather than pathfinding on a per entity basis the entities can use the distance stored in the tiles to workout the path.

## LICENCE RELATED:

I have chosen the MPL 2.0 licence as it makes it easy for you to use the work in your project without worrying about it impacting your licencing.

The licencing is only a per file basis and changes to the files you make should be released under the same licence.
